Read the 7 PDFs found in https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/generate-metadata-using-Copilot.git and generate Dublin Core (dc:) and Extended Dublin Core (dcterms:) descriptive metadata for each document.  Put the metadata into a new CSV file in the working directory with headings that match those found in https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/generate-metadata-using-Copilot/blob/main/verified_CSV_headings_for_Alma-D.csv and use | characters, not semi-colons, to separate multiple values in any field.  Put the name of the PDF file into the 'file_name_1' column of the CSV.  Use the structure of https://grinnell.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01GCL_INST/1prvshj/alma991011593352104641 as guidance.
